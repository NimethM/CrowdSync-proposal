\section{General Objective}
To Design and implement a real-time crowd choreography system where each wristband is localized continuously, visual patterns (images/animations) are mapped to each device’s current position, and low-latency control frames (device ID, target color, brightness, and effect parameters) are transmitted so the audience becomes an adaptive, spatially-aware display.

\section{Specific Objectives}
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item \textbf{To Develop a Real-Time Localization of Large Number of Nodes using Ultra Wide Band(UWB) Technology}
     
     Build a scalable UWB-based localization subsystem (anchors + tags) that provides continuous position updates for thousands of devices

     \item  \textbf{Real-time point-cloud visualizer}
     
     Visualize the live 2D point cloud of localized devices overlaid on an arena map (stadium/venue seating plan) shown in Figure \ref{fig:pointcloud_ui}, Where the map of the arena can be configured using exact dimensions.

     \item \textbf{To Develop a Pattern Mapping Algorithm and Control Message generator}
     
     Develop algorithms that map an input pattern (image, video frames, or parametric animation) onto the irregular, dynamic point cloud of devices and generate relevant control signals (per-device control frames)
