	abstract = {Indoor localization has recently witnessed an increase in interest, due to the potential wide range of services it can provide by leveraging Internet of Things ({IoT}), and ubiquitous connectivity. Different techniques, wireless technologies and mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide indoor localization services in order to improve the services provided to the users. However, there is a lack of an up-to-date survey paper that incorporates some of the recently proposed accurate and reliable localization systems. In this paper, we aim to provide a detailed survey of different indoor localization techniques such as Angle of Arrival ({AoA}), Time of Flight ({ToF}), Return Time of Flight ({RTOF}), Received Signal Strength ({RSS}); based on technologies such as {WiFi}, Radio Frequency Identification Device ({RFID}), Ultra Wideband ({UWB}), Bluetooth and systems that have been proposed in the literature. The paper primarily discusses localization and positioning of human users and their devices. We highlight the strengths of the existing systems proposed in the literature. In contrast with the existing surveys, we also evaluate different systems from the perspective of energy efficiency, availability, cost, reception range, latency, scalability and tracking accuracy. Rather than comparing the technologies or techniques, we compare the localization systems and summarize their working principle. We also discuss remaining challenges to accurate indoor localization.},

	abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy ({BLE}) is a ubiquitous low-power communication technology used in many applications including location-based services. Typically, in {BLE} localization, the beacons transmit advertisement messages while moving devices infer their location from radio signal strength measurements. Previous work has noted that three radio channels used for advertisement transmission exhibit different propagation conditions including frequency dependent shadowing and multipath. Because most of the consumer electronic devices report only the measured signal strength value without the number of a channel in which it was measured, the variance of the measurements increases and adversely affects the accuracy of localization. Information on the channel used can improve the localization accuracy, however, the existing approaches are limited to three advertisement channels, ignoring the remaining 37 channels available in {BLE} communication. This article analyses the impact of channel diversity on the accuracy of {BLE}-based indoor localization. In contrast to previous work, we use signal strength measurements from all 40 channels and show that channel diversity can significantly improve the localization accuracy. Experiments conducted in 100m2 office area show that using signal strength measurements in 40 channels improves the average localization accuracy by approximately 50\% and 20\% compared to the use of 3 channels without and with information on the channel used, respectively. Overhead of the proposed method can be reduced through careful selection of the radio channels used in measurements. We propose a channel selection method which allows to significantly improve the localization accuracy using measurements collected from between 10 and 15 channels.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency ({RF}) technologies are often used to track assets in indoor environments. Among others, ultra-wideband ({UWB}) has constantly gained interest thanks to its capability to obtain typical errors of 30 cm or lower, making it more accurate than other wireless technologies such as {WiFi}, which normally can predict the location with several meters accuracy. However, mainly due to technical requirements that are part of the standard, conventional medium access strategies such as clear channel assessment, are not straightforward to implement. Since most scientific papers focus on {UWB} accuracy improvements of a single user, it is not clear to which extend this limitation and other design choices impact the scalability of {UWB} indoor positioning systems. We investigated the scalability of indoor localization solutions, to prove that {UWB} can be used when hundreds of tags are active in the same system. This paper provides mathematical models that calculate the theoretical supported user density for multiple localization approaches, namely Time Difference of Arrival ({TDoA}) and Two-Way Ranging ({TWR}) with different {MAC} protocol combinations, i.e., {ALOHA} and {TDMA}. Moreover, this paper applies these formulas to a number of realistic {UWB} configurations to study the impact of different {UWB} schemes and settings. When applied to the 802.15.4a compliant Decawave {DW}1000 chip, the scalability dramatically degrades if the system operates with uncoordinated protocols and two-way communication schemes. In the best case scenario, {UWB} {DW}1000 chips can actively support up to 6171 tags in a single domain cell (no handover) with well-selected settings and choices, i.e., when adopting the combination of {TDoA} (one-way link) and {TDMA}. As a consequence, {UWB} can be used to simultaneously localize thousands of nodes in a dense network. However, we also show that the number of supported devices varies greatly depending on the {MAC} and {PHY} configuration choices.},

Advances in a range of technologies, each suited to certain use cases and objectives, have been fueled by the capacity to precisely locate objects or people inside places. Prominent indoor localization technologies like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ultra-wideband ({UWB}), {ZigBee}, and {RFID}-based systems are examined in this review, along with hybrid solutions that combine several technologies to get around their individual drawbacks and enhance system performance. The field still faces several obstacles in spite of these developments. Widespread acceptance is hampered by persistent problems such as signal interference, high energy consumption, and restricted scalability. The deployment of these systems is further complicated by elements like cost-effectiveness, privacy issues, and compatibility in a variety of situations. This study also examines potential avenues for future research to improve the precision, dependability, and versatility of indoor localization technology in order to overcome these obstacles. Designing systems with increased resilience to environmental changes, utilizing edge computing for real-time processing, and integrating artificial intelligence for predictive modeling are all promising areas of emphasis. This study attempts to help academics and practitioners navigate the changing terrain of indoor localization by offering a comprehensive picture of the field’s present status and future directions.},

In this paper, the fundamentals of {UWB} compatibility are investigated by first giving an overview of different {UWB} radio chips on the market.

We describe compatibility issues and associated interoperability aspects related to physical ({PHY}), medium-access-control ({MAC}) and upper layers. For the {PHY} layer, compatibility is possible for all {UWB} radio chips if the correct settings are configured. For the {MAC} layer, the implementation of the multiple access scheme as well as the localization technique is mostly proprietary. For the device discovery, several standards are currently being drafted. Finally, future challenges related to {UWB} interoperability are discussed.},

	abstract = {Localization using ultra-wide band ({UWB}) signals gives accurate position results for indoor localization. The penetrating characteristics of {UWB} pulses reduce the multipath effects and identify the user position with precise accuracy. In {UWB}-based localization, the localization accuracy depends on the distance estimation between anchor nodes ({ANs}) and the {UWB} tag based on the time of arrival ({TOA}) of {UWB} pulses. The {TOA} errors in the {UWB} system, reduce the distance estimation accuracy from {ANs} to the {UWB} tag and adds the localization error to the system. The position accuracy of a {UWB} system also depends on the line of sight ({LOS}) conditions between the {UWB} anchors and tag, and the computational complexity of localization algorithms used in the {UWB} system. To overcome these {UWB} system challenges for indoor localization, we propose a deep learning approach for {UWB} localization. The proposed deep learning model uses a long short-term memory ({LSTM}) network for predicting the user position. The proposed {LSTM} model receives the distance values from {TOA}-distance model of the {UWB} system and predicts the current user position. The performance of the proposed {LSTM} model-based {UWB} localization system is analyzed in terms of learning rate, optimizer, loss function, batch size, number of hidden nodes, timesteps, and we also compared the mean localization accuracy of the system with different deep learning models and conventional {UWB} localization approaches. The simulation results show that the proposed {UWB} localization approach achieved a 7 cm mean localization error as compared to conventional {UWB} localization approaches.},

	abstract = {A large body of work has shown that ultra-wideband ({UWB}) technology enables accurate indoor localization and tracking thanks to its high time-domain resolution. Existing systems, however, are typically designed to localize only a limited number of tags, and involve the exchange of several messages following a given schedule. As a result, the scalability of current solutions in terms of tag density is limited, as well as their efficiency and responsiveness. In this paper, we present {SnapLoc}, a {UWB}-based indoor localization system that allows an unlimited number of tags to self-localize at a theoretical upper bound of 2.3 {kHz}. In {SnapLoc}, a tag obtains the responses from multiple anchors simultaneously. Based on these signals, the tag derives the time difference of arrival between anchors and estimates its position. Therefore, {SnapLoc} does not require tags to actively transmit packets, but to receive only a single message. This allows tags to passively localize themselves and ensures that the performance of {SnapLoc} does not degrade with high node densities. Moreover, due to the (quasi-)simultaneous responses, a tight clock synchronization between anchors is not needed. We have implemented {SnapLoc} on a low-cost platform based on the Decawave {DW}1000 radio and solved limitations in the transceiver’s timestamp resolution to sustain a high localization accuracy. An experimental evaluation shows that {SnapLoc} exhibits a 90\% error and median error of 33 cm and 18 cm, respectively, hence enabling decimeter-level accuracy at fast update rates for countless tags.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency ({RF}) technologies are often used to track assets in indoor environments. Among others, ultra-wideband ({UWB}) has constantly gained interest thanks to its capability to obtain typical errors of 30 cm or lower, making it more accurate than other wireless technologies such as {WiFi}, which normally can predict the location with several meters accuracy. However, mainly due to technical requirements that are part of the standard, conventional medium access strategies such as clear channel assessment, are not straightforward to implement. Since most scientiﬁc papers focus on {UWB} accuracy improvements of a single user, it is not clear to which extend this limitation and other design choices impact the scalability of {UWB} indoor positioning systems. We investigated the scalability of indoor localization solutions, to prove that {UWB} can be used when hundreds of tags are active in the same system. This paper provides mathematical models that calculate the theoretical supported user density for multiple localization approaches, namely Time Difference of Arrival ({TDoA}) and Two-Way Ranging ({TWR}) with different {MAC} protocol combinations, i.e., {ALOHA} and {TDMA}. Moreover, this paper applies these formulas to a number of realistic {UWB} conﬁgurations to study the impact of different {UWB} schemes and settings. When applied to the 802.15.4a compliant Decawave {DW}1000 chip, the scalability dramatically degrades if the system operates with uncoordinated protocols and two-way communication schemes. In the best case scenario, {UWB} {DW}1000 chips can actively support up to 6171 tags in a single domain cell (no handover) with well-selected settings and choices, i.e., when adopting the combination of {TDoA} (one-way link) and {TDMA}. As a consequence, {UWB} can be used to simultaneously localize thousands of nodes in a dense network. However, we also show that the number of supported devices varies greatly depending on the {MAC} and {PHY} conﬁguration choices.},

	abstract = {Monitoring animal welfare on farms and in research settings is attracting increasing interest, both for ethical reasons and for improving productivity through the early detection of stress or diseases. In contrast to video-based monitoring, which requires good light conditions and has difficulty tracking specific animals, recent advances in the miniaturization of wearable devices allow for the collection of acceleration and location data to track individual animal behavior. However, for broilers, there are several challenges to address when using wearables, such as coping with (i) the large numbers of chickens in commercial farms,(ii)the impact of their rapid growth, and (iii) the small weights that the devices must have to be carried by the chickens without any impact on their health or behavior. To this end, this paper describes a pilot study in which chickens were fitted with devices containing an Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}) and an Ultra-Wideband ({UWB}) sensor. To establish guidelines for practitioners who want to monitor broiler welfare and activity at different scales, we first compare the attachment methods of the wearables to the broiler chickens, taking into account their effectiveness (in terms of retention time) and their impact on the broiler’s welfare. Then, we establish the technical requirements to carry out such a study, and the challenges that may arise. This analysis involves aspects such as noise estimation, synergy between {UWB} and {IMU}, and the measurement of activity levels based on the monitoring of chicken activity. We show that {IMU} data can be used for detecting activity level differences between individual animals and environmental conditions. {UWB} data can be used to monitor the positions and movement patterns of up to 200 animals simultaneously with an accuracy of less than 20 cm. We also show that the accuracy depends on installation aspects and that errors are larger at the borders of the monitored area. Attachment with sutures had the longest mean retention of 19.5 days, whereas eyelash glue had the shortest mean retention of 3 days. To conclude the paper, we identify current challenges and future research lines in the field.},

Recently the new ultra-wideband standard {IEEE} 802.15.4z was released to increase both the robustness and security of the underlying message exchanges. Due to the lack of accessible transceivers, most of the current research on this is of theoretical nature though. This work provides the first experimental evaluation of the ranging performance in realistic environments and also assesses the robustness to different sources of interference. To evaluate the individual aspects, a set of three different experiments are conducted. One experiment with realistic movement and two additional with targeted interference. It could be shown that the cryptographic additions of the new standard can provide sufficient information to improve the reliability of the ranging results under multi-user interference significantly.},

	abstract = {Indoor localization and context-awareness are becoming two of the key technologies to for a large variety of applications. Real-time locating systems with centimeter accuracy and low power consumption have recently been made available by employing the Ultra {WideBand} ({UWB}) technology. Since 2015, Decawave has produced commercial {UWB} integrated circuits, exploiting time-of-flight measurement techniques to estimate the distance between two agents. This work presents a performance study between two Decawave transceivers, the {DW}1000 and the new {DW}3000 released in 2020. The testing space includes areas under line-of-sight and diverse non-line-of-sight conditions caused by the reflection of the {UWB} radio signals across various obstacles. Finally, we analyze the power consumption in distinct configurations, providing a comparison between the two devices. Results show that the two have similar precision in measurement ranges above one meter, while the {DW}3000 performs, on average, 33.2\% better considering shorter distances. Moreover, the new transceiver features reduced power consumption by almost 50\% during real-time measurements reaching an average value of 55 {mW}.},
